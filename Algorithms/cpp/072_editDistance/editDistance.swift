* 
* Given two words word1 and word2, find the minimum number of steps required to 
* convert word1 to word2. (each operation is counted as 1 step.)
* 
* You have the following 3 operations permitted on a word:
* 
* a) Insert a character
* b) Delete a character
* c) Replace a character
* 
* 输入: word1 = "horse", word2 = "ros"
* 输出: 3
* 解释: 
* horse -> rorse (将 'h' 替换为 'r')
* rorse -> rose (删除 'r')
* rose -> ros (删除 'e')
